Why this portfolio project then? 
After my two years of Computer Science DUT in Montpellier, I wanted to create my first portfolio to show what I am capable of with my computer science knowledge. Moreover, it would allow me to have a place where I could redirect people if they wanted to know more about my work. 
But I didn't want to stop with the knowledge I had acquired in courses or self-taught, I wanted to learn more. 
That's why I wanted to integrate the **Three.js** technology into this project. 

## How did I code it? 
### Three js :dizzy:
I started by making the base of the portfolio in my **script.js** file with three js. I chose the geometries I wanted, I placed them.
Then I added some particles to make the project a bit more lively, you can notice that they are randomly generated. 
The rest happens in a for loop at the end of the javascript file.
I store all the geometries in an array and in this loop I modify the rotation of the x and y axis according to the **delta time **.

### Sass and GSAP :wave:
To all this, I added html elements to be able to write text. 
I animated all these small elements with gsap.

### The project part :clap:
For this part I simply have a grid made of images from 
[3Dicons](https://3dicons.co).
On top of that I made some small pop ups but they still need to be reworked I must admit! 

I hope you like it ! :pleading_face:
